# Assembly Language Calculator (MIPS)
This is a fully functional calculator written in MIPS assembly, completed for a class on **Computer Organization** class in college.

Running this calculator requires:
- The MARS IDE for MIPS
- Java Calculator Class files, included in this folder.
- This code will hook into the Java Calculator interface, which acts as an approximation of the calculator hardware, and this assembly will operate on the makeshift CPU directly.
